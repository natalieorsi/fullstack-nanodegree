#Project Details
I wrote server-side code to store a list of randomly selected movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. I then served this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

This was the final project for Module 1 of the Full-Stack Nanodegree with Udacity, Programming Foundations.

#How to Use This Project
To generate a new random page with six movies:

1. Uncomment Line 12 of tmdb_api.py and replace 'Your API key here' with your API key, obtainable from https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, then save the file.
2. Run entertainment_center.py

This will generate a new fresh_tomatoes.html page with your six posters and trailers.
You can repeat this as many times as you like by repeating Step 2.
