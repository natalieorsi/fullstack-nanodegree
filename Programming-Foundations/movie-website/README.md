#Project Details
I wrote server-side code to store a list of randomly selected movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. I then served this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.

This was the final project for Module 1 of the Full-Stack Nanodegree with Udacity, Programming Foundations.
